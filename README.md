# ONNC (Open Neural Network Compiler)

## Introduction

ONNC (Open Neural Network Compiler) is a retargetable compilation framework designed specifically for proprietary deep learning accelerators. Its software architecture expedites porting ONNC to any Deep Learning Accelerator (DLA) design that supports [ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)](https://onnx.ai/) operators. ONNC guarantees executability across every DLA by means of transforming ONNX models into DLA-specific binary forms and leveraging the intermediate representation (IR) design of ONNX along with effective algorithms to eliminate the overhead of data movement. **ONNC is the first open source compiler available for NVDLA-based hardware designs**. Its NVDLA backend can compile a model into an executable NVDLA Loadable file. Integrating ONNC with the NVDLA software stack opens up opportunities for developers and researchers to explore the NVDLA-based inference design at system level.

## Getting Started

There are three ways to build ONNC:

1. Build ONNC via Docker  
    Please refer to the [ONNC Utilities](docs/ONNC-Utilities.md) document.
2. Build ONNC via ONNC umbrella  
    Please follow the [instructions of README.md](https://github.com/ONNC/onnc-umbrella) in **onnc-umbrella**.  
    [Here](https://github.com/ONNC/onnc-umbrella/tree/master/external) is the version of external library we are using in ONNC. 
3. Build ONNC without ONNC umbrella  
    Please refer to the [ONNC CMake build instruction](docs/build.md)
